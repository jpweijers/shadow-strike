# Shadow Strike

Shadow strike is 2D hack-and-slash game, built entirely from scratch--no frameworks, no libraries, no game engine. Just pure TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) interacting directly with the browser's Canvas API.

This project is more than just a game. It's a journey of learning and mastery. By avoiding external tools, Shadow Strike provides deep understanding of the fundamentals of game development and software architecture.
